 * BIP-371 taproot PSBT fields that the [Psbt] reader does not model directly.
 *
 * The reader routes any key whose type byte is not in its known set into `unknown`, and the writer
 * re-emits `unknown` verbatim, so these fields already survive a read/write round trip untouched.
 * Reading them through an extension property — the same approach
 * [Bip374Fields][com.gorunjinian.vaultovich.silentpayments.Bip374Fields] takes — keeps
 * that property intact. Promoting one of these into the reader's known set *without* adding a
 * matching writer branch would silently drop it from every signed PSBT, so prefer this.
