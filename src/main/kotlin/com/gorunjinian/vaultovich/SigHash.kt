     * This is deliberately an allow-list rather than a range check. `Transaction.hashForSigningSchnorr`
     * guards with `sighashType <= 0x03 || sighashType in 0x81..0x83`, which a *negative* value
     * satisfies — and the sighash type is parsed from `PSBT_IN_SIGHASH_TYPE` as a signed Int, so a
     * PSBT declaring 0xFFFFFFFF arrives as -1, passes that guard, and is then masked into
     * SIGHASH_SINGLE | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY. Signing a digest whose semantics were never computed or
     * shown to the user is exactly what this device exists to prevent.
     *
     * NB: only valid for taproot. Legacy and segwit-v0 have a different valid set (0x00 is *not*
     * valid there), so do not reuse this for those branches.

     * Two distinct things go wrong without this guard, because the digest commits to the full
     * 32-bit value (`writeUInt32`) while only the low byte is appended to the signature:
     *  - an undefined byte (0x00, 0x41, …) yields a signature no verifier will accept;
     *  - a value above one byte (0x101) signs over 0x00000101 while the verifier recomputes with
     *    0x00000001, so the signature is silently unverifiable.
