/**
 * BIP-352 **receive-side** signing math (Story B): spending a silent-payment output we received.
 *
 * The watching wallet found the output and supplies its per-output tweak `t_k` (or
 * `t_k + label_tweak` mod n for labeled receives) via `PSBT_IN_SP_TWEAK`. The cold device holds
 * `b_spend` and computes the one-shot signing key `d = (b_spend + tweak) mod n`, then Schnorr-signs
 * the taproot key path with `d`. `d·G` equals the output's taproot key `P_k`, which the caller must
 * verify against the input's scriptPubKey before signing.
